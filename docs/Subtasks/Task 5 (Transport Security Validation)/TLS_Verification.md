# Gmail Encryption & TLS Verification

## Goal
Verify whether emails are transmitted securely via TLS by inspecting headers or sending test messages.

## Existing Technologies & Methodologies

### 1. Header Parsing
- Analyze `Received:` headers for `TLS` or `ESMTPS` indicators.

**Strengths:**
- Works passively on received emails.
- Lightweight and simple.

**Weaknesses:**
- Header format can vary.
- TLS presence â‰  strong encryption.

### 2. `smtplib` TLS Tests
- Actively verify TLS by sending test emails with TLS required.

**Strengths:**
- Confirms if a server supports STARTTLS.

**Weaknesses:**
- Only verifies outbound, not inbound encryption.
