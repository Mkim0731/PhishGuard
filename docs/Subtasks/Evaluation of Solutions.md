# Content Analysis

### Existing Solutions:
* Gmailâ€™s Spam & Phishing Detection System: Multi-layered system with NLP, template matching, and metadata analysis. Highly scalable, trained on billions of emails.
* BERT/RoBERTa (via HuggingFace): Transformer-based deep learning models fine-tuned for phishing classification.
* SpaCy / NLTK: Efficient preprocessing libraries used for tokenization, lemmatization, and entity recognition.
### Limitations:
* Struggles with adversarial content manipulation (e.g., typos, homoglyph attacks, Unicode spoofing).
* No unified pipeline integrating both semantic content and structured metadata.
* Gmailâ€™s system is non-reproducible (black-box); not transparent or open-source.
* BERT/RoBERTa models are computationally expensive for real-time deployment.
### Improvements:
* Hybrid model: DistilBERT (lightweight) + XGBoost (structured features)
  * DistilBERT: Lightweight transformer for semantic analysis (60% faster than BERT).
  * XGBoost: Handles structured features (e.g., sender history, grammar errors).
  * Combination: Merge model outputs with meta-learner for final score.
* Adversarial training with generated phishing examples.
  * Generate phishing examples using misspellings, fake login prompts, hidden redirects, etc.
  * Improves detection of evasive phishing techniques often missed by standard classifiers.

# Link Checks

### Existing Solutions:
* Regex/Heuristics: Fast but brittle
* URLNet: Detects obfuscation but data-hungry
### Limitations:
* Fails against zero-day domains
* No real-time URL expansion checks
### Improvements:
* Live DNS/WHOIS lookup + screenshot analysis
  * Flag domains registered <7 days ago.
  * Detect mismatched registrar/country.

# Spoof Detection

### Existing Solutions:
* Python Email Module / dkimpy / pyspf: Protocol-compliant tools for parsing and validating SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
* Mailparser: High-level .eml parser for extracting headers.
* Header Parsing (TLS): Checks Received headers for encryption indicators.
* smtplib + STARTTLS: Actively verifies server TLS support.

### Limitations:
* SPF/DKIM can be spoofed or misconfigured.
* Header formats vary; inconsistent TLS indicators.
* No behavioral analysis (e.g., geo-location shifts, unusual login/email origination).
* Inbound TLS status cannot be verified via active tests.

### Improvements:
* Unify validation pipeline: Combine spoofing and TLS checks into one module.
* Add sender reputation scoring based on:
   Domain age and TLS adoption.
   Historical sending patterns (volume, frequency).
   Geographic consistency between login location and email origin.
* Fallback heuristics: Flag mismatched headers, missing Return-Path, or suspicious IPs when auth fails.

# Real Time Alerts

### Existing Solutions:
* Chrome Extensions: Tight UI integration
* JavaScript Alerts / React Popups
* Email Security Gateways (Proofpoint, Mimecast)
* Web Push Notifications (Firebase/Web API)

### Limitations:
* Gmail DOM changes can break extension functionality
* Alerts often lack context or explanation, leading users to ignore them.
* Email security gateways are costly and not customizable for individual users.
* Web push requires user opt-in and backend infra.

### Improvements:
* DOM-agnostic detection via Gmail Add-on APIs
* ðŸ”— Gmail Add-ons API Docs
   â†’ Avoid breakage from DOM structure changes.
   â†’ Access raw headers, metadata, and message payloads directly.
* Alert Enhancement: Include detailed context (e.g., failed SPF/DKIM, suspicious links).
* Hybrid Approach: Combine browser-based alerts + push notifications for persistent cross-device warnings.
