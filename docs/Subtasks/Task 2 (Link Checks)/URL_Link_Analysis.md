# URL & Link Analysis

## Goal
Scan embedded links in emails for signs of phishing or malicious behavior.

## Existing Technologies & Methodologies

### 1. Google Safe Browsing API
- cloud-based phishing and malware link scanner. Checks URLs against continuously updated blacklists of known malicious domains and phishing infrastructure.

**Strengths:**
- Real-time lookup from Googleâ€™s global threat intelligence.
- Seamlessly integrates into browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and email filters (e.g., Gmail, G Suite).

**Weaknesses:**
- Relies heavily on known-bad domain lists (blacklists)
- Delayed response to zero-day phishing URLs that haven't been seen before.

### 2. Regex / Heuristic-Based Analysis
- Use of pattern matching for blacklisted terms, domain features.

**Strengths:**
- Fast and simple to implement.
- Can flag known suspicious patterns quickly.

**Weaknesses:**
- Easy to bypass with small mutations.
- High false positives.

### 3. PhishTank / VirusTotal API
- Query external threat intelligence databases to verify URLs.

**Strengths:**
- Provides up-to-date data on malicious domains.
- Easy to integrate.
- Uses blacklist databases, heuristic analysis, and signature-based detection across 70+ engines
- Reports also include protocols used, redirects, and embedded resource behavior.

**Weaknesses:**
- Depends on third-party availability and API rate limits.
- Not optimized for real-time email pipelines due to public query rate limits and latency
