RESEARCH QUESTION: -  Can a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on raw URL text accurately 
                      classify phishing vs. benign URLs without relying on handcrafted features?
Dataset:
We will use the same dataset provided by the DEPHIDES authors, which contains approximately 5.2 million labeled URLs (phishing and legitimate).
This dataset is available publicly through the paperâ€™s GitHub repository, making it easy to download and integrate.
https://github.com/ebubekirbbr/dephides/tree/main/dataset

Tools:
The DEPHIDES system was implemented using the following tools and libraries:

Python 3.8
TensorFlow 2.2 for model training and evaluation
Keras (as part of TensorFlow) for model building
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib for plotting training performance
Scikit-learn for computing evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score
