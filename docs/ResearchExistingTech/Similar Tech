Summary of their approach: -

📦 Data Collection
Phishing URLs: 5,000 samples from PhishTank

Legitimate URLs: 5,000 samples from the University of New Brunswick's dataset

All data files are in the repository’s DataFiles folder.


🧪 Feature Extraction
17 features are extracted from URLs, categorized into:

Address bar-based features (9)

Domain-based features (4)

HTML & JavaScript-based features (4)

Detailed feature extraction is documented in URL Feature Extraction.ipynb.


🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
Decision Tree

Random Forest

Multilayer Perceptrons

XGBoost

Autoencoder Neural Network

Support Vector Machines

Training and evaluation are detailed in Phishing Website Detection_Models & Training.ipynb.


✅ Best Performing Model
XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy: 86.4%

Saved model: XGBoostClassifier.pickle.dat

Implemented it using a browser extension.

🧰 Key Features
Email Classification: Labels emails as "Phishing" or "Not Phishing".

Text Preprocessing: Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert email text into features.

Model Training: Trains ML models (default: Random Forest) on labeled data.

Prediction: Allows prediction of new emails based on trained model.

Optional: Flask integration for web deployment.

🧪 Workflow
Step-by-step Process:
Preprocess Data

Run preprocess.py to vectorize emails and save processed data.

Train the Model

Run train.py to train and save the ML model as phishing_detector.pkl.

Uses RandomForestClassifier by default.

Make Predictions

Run predict.py to test new email samples.

Modify email_text to test custom messages.

🧱 Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn (ML models)

Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)

Pickle (model serialization)

TF-IDF Vectorization (NLP)

Flask (optional, for deployment)

🗂️ Dataset
The following open-source email datasets were used:

SpamAssassin

Spam/Ham Dataset
Each dataset includes labeled phished and legitimate emails.

🔍 Feature Extraction
Emails were processed using NLP tools to extract relevant features.

These features were then used to train various machine learning and deep learning models.
