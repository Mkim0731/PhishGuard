Summary of their approach: -

ðŸ“¦ Data Collection
Phishing URLs: 5,000 samples from PhishTank

Legitimate URLs: 5,000 samples from the University of New Brunswick's dataset

All data files are in the repositoryâ€™s DataFiles folder.


ðŸ§ª Feature Extraction
17 features are extracted from URLs, categorized into:

Address bar-based features (9)

Domain-based features (4)

HTML & JavaScript-based features (4)

Detailed feature extraction is documented in URL Feature Extraction.ipynb.


ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models Used
Decision Tree

Random Forest

Multilayer Perceptrons

XGBoost

Autoencoder Neural Network

Support Vector Machines

Training and evaluation are detailed in Phishing Website Detection_Models & Training.ipynb.


âœ… Best Performing Model
XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy: 86.4%

Saved model: XGBoostClassifier.pickle.dat

Implemented it using a browser extension.
